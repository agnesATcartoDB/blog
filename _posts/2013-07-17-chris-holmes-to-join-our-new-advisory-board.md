“_I’m excited to be the first member of CartoDB’s advisory board and look forward to working with the team Javier and Sergio have assembled,” said Holmes. “I have known the team for years, and this is a particularly exciting time for CartoDB, as they’ve built the most user-friendly geospatial software I’ve ever seen, by putting design first, open sourcing everything, and focusing solely on the web. CartoDB has been contributing great improvements to the open source geospatial community and I look forward to work with them for its wider market adoption_”.

Welcome Chris!
