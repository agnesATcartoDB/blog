The dynamic of today’s media and communication is described as “soundbite culture,” in reference to our increased consumption of information and impatience with reading long text. Coupled with the proliferation of digital screens, data visualization now dominates daily life. **But we have hardly been taught how to communicate in visual ways**.

This makes sense, as only television screens existed when many of us were taught to read and write. Even younger generations have trouble keeping up because the education system often lags behind the forefront of digital innovations. Yet obtaining, analyzing and communicating in visual ways is key to most professions—not to mention social contact.
 
In the future, people will marvel at how we once tried to separate the digital from the real. So, how might we kick-start the learning curve?
 
Here at CartoDB, we value open access and self-directed learning. Our platform is designed in kind and so are our resource initiatives, which is why we’ve selected the following links and tools to help you upgrade your data visualization skills. We can’t wait to see what you can do!
