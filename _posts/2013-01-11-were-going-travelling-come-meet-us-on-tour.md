It may not be of the same scale as in the Rolling Stones Tour visualization we put together a while back, but CartoDB is going on tour. 

Starting next week, the 14th, we begin the tour in Denver, Colorado, at <a href="http://mapbrief.com/2012/11/21/js-geo-2013-a-meeting-of-javascript-mappers-in-denver/" target="_blank">JS.geo</a>, where  you’ll be able to catch <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewxhill" target="_blank">Andrew</a>, on both the 14th for talks and the 15th, for a bit of collaborative coding and/or free-association white-boarding. We'll also have a workshop on the 15th. Head over and <a href="http://geojs.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">get your tickets</a>. 

Starting at more or less the same time, we will also be in San Francisco, and you’ll be able to catch us for drinks on Tuesday the 15th at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/thieves-tavern-san-francisco" target="_blank">Thieves Tavern</a> (_We'll announce it on <a href="http://twitter.com/cartodb" target="_blank">Twitter</a>_), and then later that week <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre" target="_blank">Javier</a>, our CEO will also be speaking at the Hive in Palo Alto about visualizing large and complex geospatial data sets and building location aware applications. You can check out more information here, via the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SF-Bay-Areas-Big-Data-Think-Tank/events/97766452/" target="_blank">Big Data Think Tank</a>.

This doesn't mean that we've forgotten about home, quite the contrary, later in January we're planning a CartoDB for beginners meetup, pleace and time TBD, but you can <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycgis/events/98909162/" target="_blank">sign up here</a>, and then in late January, we’ll be making a trip across the river to help out with <a href="http://www.hackjersey.com/" target="_blank">Hack Jersey</a>, a hackathon focused on bringing the data journalism and developer communities together. We’ll be on hand to help out, and the winner will receive the credit equivalent to one year of CartoDB's Magellan Plan, so if you're in the Tri-State Area, sign on up. 

The saga then continues back in Europe, as we head over to present at <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" target="_blank">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona from the 25th to the 28th of February. Should you be attending MWC, by all means stop by. 

Sow whether it’s San Francisco, Colorado, New Jersey, or Barcelona, or even at our home offices in New York, and Madrid. We hope to see you soon.
