We are participating today in the sixth edition of "SIG Libre", a conference on GIS organized by Universitat de Girona. It's one of the main events of its kind held in Spain, with a special focus on free tools for cartography, statistical analysis, and database technology. You can check the <a href="http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre2012/programa/jornadas">full program</a> and the <a href="http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre2012/programa/ponentes">keynote speakers</a> at the conference <a href="http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre2012/">website</a>. 

We submitted an abstract on CartoDB as an open source tool for importing, analysing and visualizing data. You can read it here (<a href="http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre2012/uploads/abstracts/abstracts2012/a39.pdf">pdf file</a>, in Spanish). The presentation will be held on March 23 (at 1:10pm).

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/saleiva">@saleiva</a> will demo CartoDB, which is continuously being upgraded with new functionalities -so many new features and improvements are coming up to the soon to be launched CartoDB 1.0! 

If you happen to be in Girona, we'll be happy to hear from you.
