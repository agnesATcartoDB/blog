<p>From its very beginning, CartoDB has always been about making it easier for you to create map driven applications online. </p>
<p>In that effort, we have developed numerous libraries and examples meant to help you take your maps further. Take the  <a href="https://github.com/Vizzuality/backbone.cartodb" title="CartoDB Backbone Library">CartoDB Backbone</a> library. The backbone library gives you a super simple Javascript wrapper to connect, query, and use data you host on CartoDB from within your applications. So pretend you wanted to create an application about New York City parks.</p>

Simple right? The CartoDB Backbone libary connects through CartoDB&#8217;s SQL API, which means you can use it to mine endless data from your account and drive interaction and interfaces on your site. </p>
<p>This can be great for building things like mobile applications or data exploration tools. In my personal use of CartoDB, I use a combination of the CartoDB Backbone library and the CartoDB Leaflet libraries all the time. The most amazing part of that duo is the ability to create data-driven applications that can be hosted entirely on GitHub Pages (<a href="http://vizzuality.github.com/HTML5-experiments/" title="HTML5 Expirements">example</a>) or from my DropBox public folder. </p>
