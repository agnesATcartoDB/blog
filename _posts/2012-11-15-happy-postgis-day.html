<p>Yesterday was GIS day, so naturally today, and the next 364 days, are PostGIS days. In order to celebrate a year of PostGIS days, we’ve made this little map which we hope you like.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.96859619487077"><span> </span><br/></strong></p>
<p>Like GIS Day, PostGIS day is a grassroots effort open to everyone and is a wonderful opportunity to let people know about mapping, spatial operations, and discuss with friends the deep impact that maps, digital or otherwise, have had on our global culture and society.</p>
<p>It is no secret that CartoDB runs on top of PostGIS and we can not be more proud of. <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/team/sandro">Sandro Santilli</a><span> is our PostGIS guru here and is one of the core committers to the project. He is releasing </span><span>GEOS_3.3.6 for the day. The release fixes a segfault (meaning </span><span>a backend crash) that occurred on some hard topological operations (e.g. ST_Union,</span><span>ST_Intersection etc..). This is our present to PostGIS and we are sure everybody will enjoy a bit more stability :)</span></p>
<p>So from us to you, have a happy and wonderful 364 days of PostGIS, and happy mapping.</p>
