<p>We finished the first class in our mapping academy series last night. We think it was a tremendous success and couldn&#8217;t be happier about the turnout and reception. Thank you to everyone who joined us! If you missed the event, you can find all the details about it on the <a href="http://cartodb.com/academy">Academy homepage</a></p>

<p>You can replay the online recording now over over on YouTube. We&#8217;ve also created some high-resolution chapters of the hands-on portions of the event. Feel free to view those and do the exercises at your own pace now, or simply go back and look at portions you may have missed. </p>

<p><strong>Going forward</strong></p>
<p>So many people have already written to express their interest in the second event, <em>Intermediate Mapping</em>. We are going to start planning for that event early next week. I will kick it off just like the first one, with a poll to vote on when the event should take place. We are trying to democratize mapping online, so we figured we should democratize when we do it :)</p>
<p>Look out for a link to the poll early next week in your email, on our blog, <a href="https://twitter.com/cartodb">on Twitter</a>, and on the <a href="http://cartodb.com/academy">Academy webpage</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Last Night&#8217;s Stats</strong></p>
<p>Besides a few minor hiccups, the event went really great. At the beginning we expected a small group of people to get together and learn about maps. It turned out to be a lot bigger than that. Not only were signups through the roof, but the majority of people actually tuned in, and the majority of those who tuned in were actually following along with the hands-on lessons! That is amazing!</p>
<p><em>Number of people who signed up</em></p>
<p><strong>4500+</strong></p>
<p><em>Number of people signed on during the live stream</em></p>
<p><strong>3000+<br/></strong></p>
<p><em>Number of people who created maps during the class</em></p>
<p><strong>2500+</strong></p>
<p><strong>THANKS!</strong></p>
<p>What a fun event, we look forward to having you all for the second one!</p>
