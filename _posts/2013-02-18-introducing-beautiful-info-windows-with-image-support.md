By far one of the most popular feature requests we've received since launching almost a year ago has been more customizable info-windows. With the release of <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/cartodb-js.html" title="Cartodb.js documentation" target="_blank">CartoDB.js</a>, we made info-window customization easier than it has ever been, however, this still left a lot of our non-technical users out in the cold. However, we're happy to announce that this is no longer going to be the case. 

From now on, <a href="http://cartodb.com" title="Cartodb" target="_blank">CartoDB</a> users will have access to new info-window feature that will allow you to display an image linked directly from an external URL, much like we did on our <a href="http://cartodb.github.com/cartodb.js/examples/TheHobbitLocations/" title="The Hobbit locations map example" target="_blank">The Hobbit video recording locations map</a>, and all this will be available from the info-window customization panel. 

In order to get this up and running, you'll need to put your image URLs in a table column, and then use that column in the first position of the info-window field list. Displayed in the image below.

Easy, right? We also highly recommend that you process your images and optimize the prior to putting them into your visualization as to improve the browsing experience of your visitors.

We hope you enjoy this brand new info-windows template.<br/>Happy mapping!
