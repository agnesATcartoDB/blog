Two days ago The Guardian Data Blog published a map about all meteorites that scientist have found. We help them creating a screencast on how to make Â it. Since then we can see that it has become quite a hit! It is been linked from major sites like The Verge, Digg, HackerNews and of course The Guardian.
We promised, this map was done pretty quickly, checkout the screencast, and of course the map!
