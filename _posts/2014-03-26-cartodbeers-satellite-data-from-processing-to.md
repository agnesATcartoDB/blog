New edition of CartoDBeers! Our informal gatherings in our office to talk maps, visualization and tech. This time we are proud to welcome Chiara Solimini. Chiara has been working with the European Space Agency proccessing earth observation imagery and data to creatively visualise scientific results.

Chiara will talk about her experience followed by a Q&A session, and beers, of course. Don’t miss it: Next Tuesday April 1st in our Madrid office (C/ Eloy Gonzalo, 27). Just come by! We’ll start at 19.00



More about Chiara: Chiara Solimini worked as on-site contractor for ESA/ESRIN in Italy for more than 4 years, supporting European Space Agency (ESA) to communicate Earth Observation (EO) scientific and application results. She was creating the Image of the Week (IOW) published every week in the ESA website as well as videos and animations illustrating ESA’s EO missions achievements. Her role included the processing of all the different EO imagery and data source to creatively visualise scientific results. The processing involved the use of satellite data dedicated software, digital imaging software, compositing and video editing apps. Developing “ad hoc” routines for EO data analysis was also part of her task. Chiara holds a PhD degree in GeoInformation from Tor Vergata University of Rome.

During her stay in USA she participated to a competition “Art in Science| Science in Art” and her image was exhibited in the New York Hall of Science from February 2009 to June 2009. Three of her processed Images were selected from National Geographic as one of the Best Space Pictures for the year 2009, 2011 and 2012. One of her processed image has been used by the rock/indie band Alt-j as cover for the album “An Awesome Wave”, in 2013.

Chiara is currently working on her artistic and scientific projects.
