In just a couple of weeks we’re headed to Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference, and we’re very excited about it. Not only will this be our first time attending, but our presence this year takes a big step in defining our own mobile strategy for the future. Throughout the course of 2012, we’ve taken steps to broaden not only the CartoDB brand along certain key verticals, but also to do so within the context of mobile application design, development and content delivery. We believe that our participation in various conferences and hackathons has played a large part in building customer awareness of the CartoDB APIs, and desire MWC to have a similar impact. The feedback from the community, new users, app developers and other attendees at these conferences and hackathons is always humbling, and we truly appreciate each and every comment, tweet, blog post and article. So thank you. With MWC, we seek to expand on these initiatives and hope that for those of you attending, you’ll stop by our boots. We’ll have Jamon and Wine for you to enjoy as well as good conversation. We’re also planning a series of talks on data visualization, and have sent in proposals. We’ll keep you posted on them as things develop. If you’ll be attending MWC this year and would like to schedule a meeting with us, please fill out this form, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
