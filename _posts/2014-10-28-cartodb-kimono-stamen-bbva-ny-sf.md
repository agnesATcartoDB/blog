We live exciting times when it comes to working with data and creating useful products for citizens and organizations. The open data trend keeps growing solidly: public administrations and organizations all over the world keep pushing the boundaries with very good opening projects. On the tools front, simpler and more powerful APIs and tools keep popping up, enabling that more and more people capture and process huge quantities of data, and its analysis and better communication. 

To talk about all these things we have set up a series of events: we have united with some friends that represent very well these emerging trends, and that have very interesting stories to share: 

* **Kimono Labs**: create APIs from standard websites. A magical window to automate data gathering. [Start APIfying now](http://kimonolabs.com).
* **Stamen**: the best data visualization studio out there? [Not many introductions are needed](http://stamen.com/).
* **BBVA**: one of the first banks creating data APIs to access customer information. Private open data piooneers. They will be presenting the [InnovaChallenge contest](http://blog.cartodb.com/cartodb-mexico-innovachallenge/).
* **CartoDB**: Yours truly. We'll be showcasing some of our latest developments and map projects.

Expect short presentations by each and an open dialague about APIs, data visualization and maps.
