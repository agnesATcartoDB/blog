We are happy to be sponsors again for next month's <a href="http://2013.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G conference</a> in Nottingham. These is one of our favorite meetings, where many of the people we look up to come together to talk about mapping and geospatial technologies. We'd love to <a href="http://2013.foss4g.org/registration/">see you there</a>, hopefully we'll even have some t-shirts to give out. Three of our team members will be coming, <a href="http://twitter.com/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ustrk">Sandro Santilli</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/opencholmes">Chris Holmes</a>, so grab any of them to chat CartoDB.
