We are happy to be sponsors again for next month’s FOSS4G conference in Nottingham. These is one of our favorite meetings, where many of the people we look up to come together to talk about mapping and geospatial technologies. We’d love to see you there, hopefully we’ll even have some t-shirts to give out. Three of our team members will be coming, Javier de la Torre, Sandro Santilli, and Chris Holmes, so grab any of them to chat CartoDB. 

Here is what we’ll be up to at the meeting.
CartoDB 2.1
Sandro Santilli - CartoDB Project Showcase
It has been an exciting year of development for CartoDB and its technologies, here we will report those updates and the lessons we have learned from the project’s development.
Innovations in mapping time based data in CartoDB
Javier de la Torre - Vizzuality/CartoDB Temporal Visualisations
The ability to map live data and share visualizations of data that change through time is an exciting area of research at CartoDB. We will report on some of the key innovations we have developed.

Sir Clive Granger Building: B26 E - Sept. 17, 2013, 11:30 a.m. to Sept. 17, 2013, 1:30 p.m.
