On the 24th of July, our senior scientist [Andrew Hill](https://twitter.com/andrewxhill) hosted a webinar to teach how you can use [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) to develop geospatial applications.

**CartoDB for developers** was hosted for creators who would like to learn about our APIs, have full SQL access to their data directly from their application or the web and power GIS calculations on the fly.
