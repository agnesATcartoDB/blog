After a productive week in the MWC in Barcelona, we head over to Hannover to attend CEBIT, one of the biggest tech expos in the world. You’ll find us in Hall 16, Stand D30. We’ll be showcasing CartoDB’s technology and use cases, showing lots of the maps and visualizations created using CartoDB, such as the visualization of the Oscar’s night, tweets about the Ukrainian conflict, the Global Forest Watch project, our animated cumulative maps, and much more.

We are also taking part of CODE_n, CEBIT’s official awards in which CartoDB is a finalist among more than hundreds of participants. Will we win? The topic of this year’s awards is Driving the data revolution, something we are particularly good positioned to tackle.

If you want to assist to CEBIT we are giving away some tickets. Just ask for them in contact@cartodb.com - And if you want to appoint a meeting so we can show you CartoDB, just ping us.
