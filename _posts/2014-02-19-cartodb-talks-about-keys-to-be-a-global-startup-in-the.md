How it is like being a global startup? From the early days CartoDB has been a product used by people all over the world. With headquarters in New York and Madrid a distributed team has delivered a product used by thousands of people in every timezone imaginable.

CartoDBâ€™s Javier de la Torre will be talking about this incredible journey and what it takes to be a global startup, along with Juan Urdiales from Job&Talent, Eneko Knorr from Ludei and Sergio Llorens from Gigigo.

Join us in the 4YFN space, Tuesday Feb 25th from @ 11:00.
