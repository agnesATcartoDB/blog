The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has been working hard to mobilize a large number of volunteers to digitize areas of the Philippines in order to help aid efforts. We put together this map to show the results of that great effort.

If you would like more information on HOT or want to know how to help, start over here,Â Remote HOT Activation in the Philippines for Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan.
If you are curious about the map or want to add it onto your own blog or website, I recorded a screencast while creating it. Take a look at that over on Vimeo.
