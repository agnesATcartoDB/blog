<p>Following the release of the <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/post/91149570719/odyssey-js-new-open-source-tool-to-weave-interactive">new Odyssey.js tool</a> to create map based interactive stories, here you have some projects that are already using it:</p>

<p>On July 9th, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/bloody-weekend-19-injured-bullets-cops-arrest-2-article-1.1846552">New York Daily News published an investigation</a> where they tracked 16 shooting incidents that occurred in a 48 hours period. They used Odyssey.js to tell the story in a different way, using a map to give context to the facts related. Using an slide template, the US newspaper  geolocalized the reported incidents of gunfire and told the victims version.</p>

<p>They also used a CartoDB map to show in an interactive way the data of 20 years of gun violence in different parts of New York City. Through this map, readers can easily see which neighborhoods are more violent than others and how that has evolved during these years.</p>

<p>HMS Beagle ship left England for her second voyage on 27 December 1831. The ship was captained by Robert FitzRoy, and carried a then young Charles Darwin. During the expedition, Darwin kept a diary of his experiences, and rewrote this as a book. In this Odyssey.js story you can recreate this Charles Darwin’s famous journey.</p>

<p>Twitter has been using CartoDB maps to show how people tweet around the world during big events. This time, they choose Odyssey.js to describe the Wimbledon 2014&#8217;s men final and present how Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic played out on twitter.</p>
