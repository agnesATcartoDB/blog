We are excited to announce CartoDB involvement in a new project lead by A Human Right, an international nonprofit organization based in San Francisco.
Simply put, the iniative’s goal is to take idle internet, cellular, and fixed wired bandwidth and put it to work for social and humanitarian causes such as disaster relief, business development, education, telemedicine and technology exploration. 
United Nations and major telecommunications companies are already working on the project. You can read more info on A Human Right and the team behind this organization on its website. 
Kosta Grammatis, from A Human Right, sent us an email with a message addressed to anyone interested in participating on the initiative: “We’re looking for amazing volunteer developers to help get this project off the ground, it could be a great opportunity if someone’s looking to bolster their resume”. You can send him an e-mail at contact@ahumanright.org.
We’ll keep you updated on the progress of this initiative.
