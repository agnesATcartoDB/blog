Every single day we see a huge influx of beautiful maps created using CartoDB. The topics range from everything from the best places to live in the UK to seismic activity in the depths of Iceland. We decided to compile a list of some really cool maps done by huge media outlets in the last couple of days.

### Scandinavian media: Bárðarbunga volcano 


NRK, the largest media organisation in Norway, published a map made by the developer [Aitor Garcia](http://aitor.is/me/) who used the Data from Iceland's Meteorological Institute to visualize the intense seismic activity (more than 1.400 earthquakes) that a volcano known as Bárðarbunga in Iceland has displayed in the last 48 hours.
