CartoDB was yesterday at the 3rd Training Session for the Data Journalism Group at MediaLab Prado, in Madrid. @saleiva discussed how to use CartoDB for data analysis and visualization to create a narrative and tell a story.
You can watch the full workshop (in Spanish) at the MediaLab site. The slides are at Speaker Deck and the data used in the workshop is also available for download (zip).
