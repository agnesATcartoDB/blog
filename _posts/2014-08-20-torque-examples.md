Static maps can be boring at times. To spice things up a little, CartoDB has been offering the possibility to create animated Torque maps which bring the data to life in an efficient, fast, and styleable way. As the months have gone by, more and more people have started using this feature and created some amazing visualizations with it. 

<!--more-->

All CartoDB users can easily create animated maps, just by going to the [Torque option](http://blog.cartodb.com/torque-is-live-try-it-on-your-cartodb-maps-today/) in our wizard (just like your point maps and choropleths). [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) allows you to see the changes in big data over time! What can be more cool than that?

You might have stumbled upon some great visualizations depicting Twitter activity during big events around the world. In this post, we would like to show you some examples of how our customers are using Torque:

### Fires in the Amazon

InfoAmazonia used two years of data from NASA satellites to create this map. InfoAmazonia provides timely news and reports of the endangered Amazon region. A network of organizations and journalists deliver updates from the nine countries of the forest.

### Seismic activity from a volcano in Iceland

The Torque feature made it  possible to create a map displaying the schedule of the trains operating under the Long Island rail service. The maps show their regular weekday schedule. Every branch allows you to see the progression of scheduled trains. Click on the map to watch the map in detail and to know how this map was created.

### The Ellis act

The map show the number of San Francisco families forced out of their homes, between 1997 and 2014, because of the state law known as The Ellis Act. This visualization was powered not only by CartoDB but  D3 and Leaflet were also used in the developed of the map.

This visualization show World War I Royal Navy locations transcribed by the citizen scientists of [Old Weather](http://blog.oldweather.org/2012/07/23/one-million-six-hundred-thousand-new-observations/). It is interesting to see how the naval operations increased when the United States entered the war.
