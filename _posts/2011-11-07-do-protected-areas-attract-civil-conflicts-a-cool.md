This weekend was #EcoHackNYC where we were really happy to see lots of people using CartoDB for their projects! Here is a quick mention about one of the projects developed there in an afternoon; a cool map and a null model statistical analysis looking at the relationship of civil conflicts in relation to Protected Areas in Democratic Republic of Congo.  (Good work to Simon and Sergio who were part of the team!) 
Take a look and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions about it!
