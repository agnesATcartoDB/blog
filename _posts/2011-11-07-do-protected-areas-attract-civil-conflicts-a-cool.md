This weekend was #<a title="ecohack" target="_blank" href="http://www.ecohacknyc.org">EcoHackNYC</a> where we were really happy to see lots of people using <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> for their projects! Here is a quick mention about one of the projects developed there in an afternoon; a cool map and a null model statistical analysis looking at the relationship of civil conflicts in relation to Protected Areas in Democratic Republic of Congo. (Good work to <a title="simon" target="_blank" href="http://vizzuality.com/team/stokumine">Simon</a> and <a title="saleiva" target="_blank" href="http://vizzuality.com/team/saleiva">Sergio</a> who were part of the team!) 

<a title="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ecohacknyc.org/projects/conflicts_and_protected_areas/">Take a look</a> and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about it!
