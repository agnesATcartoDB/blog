The online summit **Visual Data Discovery and Analytics** will next take place on September 17th and 18th. With names like David White, from [import.io](http://import.io), and visualization expert [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/albertocairo), as well as companies like Datameer, Tableau,  Bank of America, and SAS, among others, the Visual Data Discovery and Analytics Summit is a comprehensive online event to dive into the possibilities produced by visual analytics.

CartoDB will be represented by our Senior Scientist, [Andrew Hill](https://andrew.cartodb.com), who will be talking about [Unlocking Rich Information from Geospatial Data](https://www.brighttalk.com/r/svT) on Sep 18, 2014 (9AM PDT / 12AM EDT / 18PM CEST). Here is the abstract for his session: 

> For decades GIS and geospatial data have been trapped on the desktop. Building robust applications or extracting meaningful insights took expensive and difficult to use technologies. All that is changing. In this webinar, we'll look at how geospatial has moved to the web and how you can leverage your own geospatial data to gain insights, create better communications, and tell better stories. We'll focus on CartoDB and how a user can go from data to maps and information in minutes.

[You can sign up for free in the summit web](https://www.brighttalk.com/r/svT).
