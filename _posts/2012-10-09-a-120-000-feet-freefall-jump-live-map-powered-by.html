<p>When we read about Felix Baumgartner plans to ascend to 120,000 feet and make a freefall jump rushing toward earth at supersonic speeds before parachuting to the ground in Rosswell, New Mexico, we were pretty excited.</p>
<p>The Baumgartner&#8217;s freefall jump is part of the so-called Red Bull Stratos scientific challenge, a mission to the edge of space. &#8220;Never before has anyone reached the speed of sound without being in an aircraft&#8221;, says Dr. Jonathan Clark, from the Red Bull Stratos team.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a live broadcast of the challenge <a href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/live">here</a>. It also features live data such as the location and the vertical speed. </p>
<p>The challenge was delayed for a few days and it finally moved forward on Sunday, October 14 at 6am local time. As Baumgartner rushed towards Rosswell, we run a test by fetching the live GPS coordinates coming in from the Red Bull Strato site and putting them into CartoDB, visualizing it all on a real-time map. </p>
<p>This video captures the live, experimental demo map powered by CartoDB along the video of the challenge as Felix Baumgartner opens his parachute and lands safely on his feet:</p>
