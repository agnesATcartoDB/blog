Our good friend Mike Giddens of Silver Biology let us know of a tool they have developed that takes the web maps you make with CartoDB, and generates static, printable versions.  While slippy web maps are great, there are also times when a printed map is best, such as in a presentation, or as part of a PDF. 
For more information on this great tool, check out the Silver Biology Blog, and the code on GitHub!
