If you are following [our repositories](https://github.com/CartoDB) or you are using Odyssey.js you would have discover that we have been using markdown a lot during the last few months. 

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and then convert it to HTML to post online. Because markdown text files are simply plain-text, you can use almost any text editor to open them.

## Why did we choose Markdown initially and we use it more and more everyday? 

### It’s easy.
The syntax is really simple. If you know how to write a hashtag or write an emoticon, you can write Markdown.

### It’s fast. 
The simple formatting saves a significant amount of time when thinking about formatting and aesthetics. With Markdown you focus on the content, not in the shape. It speeds up our workflows, from development to management tasks.

### It’s multi-platform.
Your documents are cross-platform by nature. You can edit them in any plain text editor, or directly in github. There are also a [wide-range](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) [of](https://stackedit.io) [markdown](http://markdownpad.com) [editors](http://mouapp.com) out there.

### It’s solid. 
When converting to HTML, markdown translates quickly to perfectly-formed documents. No missing closing tags or no improperly nested tags. No needing to explain complex things about classes or nodes.

## Are those real advantages in a daily day basis?

Definitely yes. We use markdown for almost everything. From writing content in our websites or creating internal documentation, to [telling stories with maps](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/) or creating to-do lists. By using it, the less technical people on the team can contribute directly to our repos or create content that is translated to something more visual later without worrying about breaking stuff.

Take a look at the [official markdown syntax website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to know more about it or don't hesitate on telling us how you use it on twitter.
