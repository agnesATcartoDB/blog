<p>We know it can be challenging to pick the right tools to create a successful project. Good developers, designers, and other map creators want to know that the tools they use will value to their work. They want to kick the tires, test the capacity, understand the limits. That is why we have always provided users with a free account tier. But what about testing our larger developer accounts? Today we are announcing our new <a href="http://cartodb.com/pricing">free 14-day trial period</a> for all Magellan plan upgrades.</p>

<p>We believe we have some of the best customers on the web. It makes us really proud to see how many CartoDB adopters remain committed to the platform. If you are considering using CartoDB for an existing or upcoming project, we think that you&#8217;ll see the value of our service pretty quickly too. Try out a Magellan for <a href="http://cartodb.com/pricing">free right now</a> and let us know what you think! </p>
<p><span>The 14-day trial will come with all the benefits of our paid service, including map views and dedicated support through our support email. At the end of the 14-day period you&#8217;ll have the option of continuing the Magellan instance or downgrading back to a normal free plan. Either way, we hope you enjoy the opportunity to take one of our paid accounts for a spin.</span></p>
