In preparation for the EcoHack taking place later in the week, weâ€™ll be hosting a free workshop in our Madrid office to show how you can take advantage of CartoDB to develop quick prototypes, hack with data, and create visualizations from open data, among other things.

When and Where: Tuesday May 6th from 19pm to 20.15pm @ CartoDB Madrid Office (Eloy Gonzalo, 27)

The workshop is free, but registration is required to have the beers ready! ;)
