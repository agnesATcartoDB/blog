A warm welcome to Rafa de la Torre, who is joining CartoDB to make our [geocoder](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#geocoding-data) and our [API's in general](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform.html) faster and powerful. He comes from Tuenti - the leading social network in Spain - where he was a Senior Software Engineer working on the Social Platform team. Before that he also was part of the Messaging Products team at Motorola.
