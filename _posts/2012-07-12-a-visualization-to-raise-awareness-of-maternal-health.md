<a href="http://www.doctorsoftheworld.org/">Doctors of the World</a> is a healthcare and humanitarian aid charity working worldwide to provide solutions that improve health and save lives. Its Spanish branch is launching this week the campaign <a href="http://www.elvirusdelasalud.org/">"The health virus"</a>, an initiative to raise awareness of the global right to health focused on the maternal health challenge &#8212;every two minutes, a woman dies from complications related to pregnancy. 

Digital creative agency <a href="http://simbiotica.es/">Simbiotica</a>, has developed a <a href="http://www.elvirusdelasalud.org/mapa/salud-materna/">dynamic visualization</a> of individual donations supporting global health initiatives. The whole campaign was created and directed by <a href="http://yslandia.com/">Yslandia</a>. In a grid of red and blue points, the project displays the so-called "health virus": How personal contributions can grow virally and promote high-impact, worldwide projects that save lives. 

Here there's a screenshot of the visualization, done with CartoDB.  As you can see this is not really a classic map. In this project Simbiotica used CartoDB technology to create an interactive visualization with thousands of points in a canvas. Pretty different use of the technology so far.

This is a quick map we made on maternal health. It shows the number of women who died in 2010 during pregnancy and childbirth as a ratio per 100,000 live births.

The <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT">original dataset</a> is from the World Bank open data site.

It is great to see such a creative use of CartoDB for a story that matters. Congrats to Doctors of the World and Simbiotica for this initiative.
