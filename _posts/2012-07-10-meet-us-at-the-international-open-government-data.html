<p>Putting data to work. That&#8217;s the next step of the open data movement and the theme of the second <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/conference">International Open Government Data Conference</a> (IOGDC), starting today at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington. World Bank&#8217;s president <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Yong_Kim">Jim Young Kim</a> first public speech is kicking off the meeting, co-sponsored by the U.S. General Services Administration, Data.gov, the World Bank Open Data Initiative and the Open Development Technology Alliance.</p>
<p>The IOGDC <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/conference/virtual-conference">Virtual Conference</a> on best practices from around the world is ongoing since last Friday. It&#8217;s been available through streaming. We&#8217;ve participated with a lightning talk on how to use CartoDB with open government data to build maps and location-aware apps with ease.</p>
<p>If you are attending the meeting, feel free to visit our booth (it will be decorated with the image below). We&#8217;ll be demoing CartoDB and attending requests.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in exploring CartoDB, we&#8217;ll show you how to import your data, mashup datasets, use it to explore and discover new relationships in your data, and publish and share your work. We&#8217;ll also show you how to use CartoDB as your datastore.</p>
<p>The IOGDC will be a great opportunity to meet experts, policy makers, developers and others working in open government. It will also promote a &#8220;dynamic discussion around the historic opportunity presented by open government data to foster collaboration, transparency, and interactive public participation&#8221;. O’Reilly Media’s Correspondent, Alex Howard, will liveblog the conference <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/iogdc/">here</a>. </p>
<p>See you there!</p>
