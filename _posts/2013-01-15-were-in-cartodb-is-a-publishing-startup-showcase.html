<p><a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/27033?cmp=ba-toc-tc13-startup-showcase-finalist"><img alt="image" height="220" src="http://i.imgur.com/g3eBY.png" width="618"/></a>Yesterday, O’Reilly Media announced the finalists for its Publishing Startup Showcase, and we’re very excited to say that we&#8217;ve been selected as one of ten startups.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an honor to be included in a group of such <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/27033" target="_blank">progressive companies</a> who are disrupting and impacting the publishing industry, and as a non-traditional company in the space, we are humbled. <br/><br/>According to the <a href="http://www.toccon.com/" target="_blank">TOC website</a>, the objective of the Startup Showcase is to give groundbreaking startups a change to show their stuff to the world.</p>

<p> “Highlighting the startup ecosystem’s creativity and variety, the Showcase will give young companies in the publishing space a chance to get their company in front of a global community of leaders in the publishing and technology industries, as well as potential investors.” - O&#8217;Reilly Media</p>

<p>The methodology to chose the ten finalists this year differed in that the public was able to cast their votes for any of the final twenty companies chosen as semi-finalists.</p>
<div>
<p>While we don&#8217;t know what position we ranked in the final ten, we want to extend a big thank you to all of you who voted for us.</p>
<p>The conference takes place this February, from the 12th to the 14th here in New York, and should you be attending we would love to hear from you, and by all means stop by and say hello. </p>
