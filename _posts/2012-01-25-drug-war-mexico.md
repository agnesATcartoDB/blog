Today we get the surprise of a really interesting visualization developed using CartoDB.Diego Valle has done this powerful visualization about the drug war in Mexico.
This is the and example of the data intensive interactive visualizations that can be done with CartoDB and other great Open Source tools like Protovis or R.
Congratulations Diego, this is a really interesting development.
