The digital world is flooded by CartoDB maps. Every day we see more and more visualizations created using our tool with everything from a map that shows how a hashtag quickly spread on Twitter to an interactive story about the elections  to the role forested landscapes play in food security and nutrition. Here is  a list of maps that have been wowing the web for the last couple of days.

The Swiss French-language daily newspaper, [Le Temps](http://www.letemps.ch/), created [two maps](http://www.letemps.ch/interactive/2014/prime-assurance-maladie/) that allow you to explore the amount of premiums per insured township by category (adult, young adult and children) and their evolution compared to 2014.

The Ebola epidemic quickly spread around Liberia taking the lives of hundreds of people. This map, a project commissioned by Liberia's Ministry of Information and Communication, seeks to provide a central location for the latest data about the disease.

*HeForShe* is the new gender equality campaign launched the past week by UN Women during a speech by Emma Watson (UN Women’s Goodwill Ambassador).
