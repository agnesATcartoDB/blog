What a month, we just finished <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/post/20769138097/cartodb-v1-0-launched-at-where-conference">Where conference</a> and we are ready to attend another conference. This time it will be the great <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/">FOSS4G North America Conference</a> in Washington DC.
