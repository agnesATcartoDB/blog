We’re very happy to announce that we are partnering with Azavea to implement GeoTrellis in CartoDB. At the same time, Azavea will add CartoDB to the suite of tools the company uses to build custom geospatial applications for their clients.
GeoTrellis is a high performance, open source, raster processing engine that when paired with CartoDB opens a new world of geographic data processing, mapping, and tool development online. From inside the CartoDB service, GeoTrellis will provide distributed processing to users and bring near-real-time results for raster based queries. Combining GeoTrellis with the already high performance vector tools in CartoDB and the sky is the limit. Need the average rainfall of Myanmar? No problem. Hill slopes in San Francisco? Got it. Average population density of all countries that have a name starting with ‘Y’? Done.
We are excited about all the possibilities that this partnership will bring and can not wait to see the new tools and analyses that will come out of it. With GeoTrellis and Azavea, CartoDB is working to make possible a new class of geospatial applications on the web.
