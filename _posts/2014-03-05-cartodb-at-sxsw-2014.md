CartoDB will be at SXSW 2014 in the great city of Austin. SXSW has grown into the most amazing place to learn and listen to the latest ideas and technologies in the interactive arena.  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jatorre">Javier de la Torre</a>, CartoDB’s CEO, will be presenting in the panel **<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP20942">Why Non-Profits Should Embrace Data Journalism</a>**, along with Becca Aaronson (The Texas Tribune) and Megan Kilgore (Capital Area Food Bank of Texas). Meet them next Sunday March 9, 3:30PM - 4:30PM.

You’ll learn why CartoDB is the perfect tool to develop your non-profit data journalism projects, and the easiest way to visualize your data in order to understand it and take decisions and communicate efectively.
