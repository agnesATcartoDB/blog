As many of you know, we are very involved in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geonyc/">GeoNYC</a> meetings, helping to organize, contribute to, and sponsor for over a year now. It has been exciting to see the active geo community grow so quickly over that time. Tonight will be <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geonyc/events/119499782/">one of the biggest</a> GeoNYC meetings to date, with a sellout crowd of 130 mappers joining us at Google.

As our part of the night, we will be presenting a 5-minute tutorial on building a data collection app with only Google Forms and CartoDB. For those of you who read our blog regularly, you may have read about this method previously, but we thought it would be interesting for people to see live and have the opportunity to talk and ask questions over a beer after the meeting. 

If you weren’t quick enough to get on this month’s RSVP list, be sure to get ahead of the crowd for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geonyc/events/114003442/">July 8th meeting</a>. We will be coming together at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> headquarters in Manhattan and are already putting together a fun lineup. See you soon!
