On Monday, May 19th at 7PM we are going to be getting together for happy hour in NYC. This will be a fun time for us to meet with some of our awesome users and chat with anyone interested in maps, technology, or what we do at CartoDB. We have an awesome user community in NYC, so we love any opportunity to bring them together. 
If you think you’ll make it, let us know so we can update you if any changes happen. 
Count me in!
