<p>Earlier this fall we launched a new wizard that allows you to create Category maps with just a couple of clicks. You have all seemed to love the feature and have made it one of our most popular visualization types. Deep down inside though, we knew it wasn’t really complete (remember,we release early but we release often), so we’ve been working hard to get it finalized for you.</p>
<p>Today we have finished part of that work and are announcing a huge improvement of the Category maps, they now support image markers for your categories. Now you can use images you upload to CartoDB for each of category you want on your map; you don’t need to code CartoCSS anymore.</p>
<p>Take a look at the video below to learn how to create your first visualization using this new functionality. In just a couple of minutes, you will have a beautiful category map using custom markers. Perfect for maps showing restaurants, shops, POI’s or telling narratives.</p>
