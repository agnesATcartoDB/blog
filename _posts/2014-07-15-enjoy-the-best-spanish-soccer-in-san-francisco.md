Do you want more soccer after the World Cup and you are in San Francisco? We invite you to attend a match between **Atlético de Madrid (2013 Spanish League winners, no less) and San Jose Earthquakes**.

The match is part of the LFP Spain Experience Creative Talent in San Francisco, happening on July 27th: A showcase of Spanish companies and Spanish Gastronomy. So if you want to attend this top class match, get a grip on the best creative spanish companies, and try the award winning spanish food, keep reading…; Also, we will be demoing our [Twitter Maps](https://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps) for Sport Coverage.

We are setting up a contest to give away two double tickets for the match and the rest of the event. The contest involves maps and visualizations, of course: **How would you summarize the World Cup in a map visualization?** Create a visualization with this theme to enter the contest.

You should create a public visualization, share it in Twitter with the hashtag #cartodbcontest and send the link of your visualization to contest@cartodb.com, all before the end of Wednesday July 23th PDT. With this, a committee of expert mappers will decide and award the invitations to the two best maps. We will send the info to the winners on Friday July 25th.
