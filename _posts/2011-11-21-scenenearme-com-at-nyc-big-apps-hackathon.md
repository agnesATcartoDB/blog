On last NYC Big Apps Hacktathon contest, the <a href="http://www.scenenearme.com">SceneNearMe</a> team developed an application to show you films that had been recorded close to your checkins on Foursquare. We made an interview to the team at our office in NY about it. Thanks to Avinash Dabir, Dan Blumberg and Luis Miranda (who couldnt make it for the interview) for sharing their experience with us!
