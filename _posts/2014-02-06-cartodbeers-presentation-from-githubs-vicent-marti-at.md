Next Monday, February 10th, <a href="https://github.com/vmg">Vicent Martí</a> is going to swing by the CartoDB office in Madrid to give us a peek into the world of GitHub. As one of the leading supporters of online open source communities, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is part of many of our daily lives. Not only are they hosting almost every major open source code base, but they are a leader in the development of social coding tools and build some amazing interfaces to go with them.

Vicent Martí is a world class developer. He started working at GitHub after <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2">developing an open source</a>, pure C implementation of the core Git methods. The library has allowed developers to create bindings to Git methods in many other languages.

We are excited to have Vicent swing by our office to tell us a bit about his work. We’d also love to invite you to join us. If you are in Madrid, feel free to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/Vizzuality/@40.4346066,-3.7005063,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4228863a517f73:0x4d02adac8f874e17">drop by</a> at 18:00 on Monday.
