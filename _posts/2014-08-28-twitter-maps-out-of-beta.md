Earlier last month, we released a beta version of [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps), which gives you the ability to map Twitter activity related to your brand or event. You can search for the terms related to your brand or event directly from the CartoDB Editor, select the period of tweets you want, and start mapping—all in a matter of minutes. 

Twitter Maps is tool designed for you to gain insights about how people are reacting to your brand or event, among other uses.  Think of it as modern and real-time market research that enables obtaining live data directly from the source, integrating it in visualizations, and sharing it online. The multifunctional CartoDB platform powers this process further with built-in data analysis, dynamic mapping, and design capabilities.

Today, we are excited to announce the next phase of our Twitter Maps service: general availability. We’ve said goodbye to beta and hello to CartoDB Enterprise customers. Get your team started on creating interactive maps from Twitter activity—search for any term, get relevant data directly from Twitter, and map it. The data comes directly from Twitter #qualitycontrol, which ensures that you get most accurate data possible. Yup, it’s really that simple. 

Stay tuned for more on Twitter Maps, and, in the meantime,  please reach out to our dedicated support team with any questions, concerns, or congrats. We love hearing from you. 

With the [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps) CartoDB service you will be able to create maps such as those Twitter itself [has](http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/brazil-croatia/#/2/24.5/-7.0/0) [been](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-sunrise/) [creating](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-india-elections/) in the last months, [which have gotten a great deal of media coverage](http://blog.cartodb.com/cartodb-twitter-maps-in-today-yahoo-espn-time-cnbc/).
