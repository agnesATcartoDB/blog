Earlier last month, we released a beta version of [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps), which gives you the ability to map tweets directly from the CartoDB Editor. Today, we are excited to announce the next phase of our Twitter Maps service: general availability for our Enterprise customers.

With this new feature you can search for the Twitter activity you want to visualize and analyze directly from the CartoDB Editor, select the period of tweets you want, and start mapping—all in a matter of minutes. We are the first geospatial analysis and visualization platform that lets you directly access Twitter data, extract it, and have it instantly available for visualization and analysis; enabling you to build complex visualizations with millions of points—something no other tool is ready to.

As Twitter has become a global and real time mirror of what is happening in the world in a given moment, being able to access tweet information opens a whole world of possibilities: from monitoring mentions about your brand or event (think of it as real time market research), to doing demographic analysis, to using Twitter activity as research material... Usages of this feature are endless. Combine that with analysis and visualization capabilities of the CartoDB Editor and you can do super advanced analysis of what is happening around you.


### <span id="comparative">Why use CartoDB to consume tweets instead of the Twitter API or other tools</span>

We have designed an integration in a way that really set us apart from any other alternative in the market, enabling you to do things that you can't do with any other tool.

- You can download millions of tweets from the last 30 days, versus the limited amount of tweets and few days limit of the official Twitter API; if you want to map an event that ocurred during last week, you could not do that just with the Twitter API, but it would be plain easy and fast through the CartoDB Editor using the new Twitter Data Source.

- With the CartoDB Twitter Data Source, you are guaranteed that you will get all geotagged tweets related to your search, not just a fraction (with Twitter API you don't know for sure)

- Retrieving the tweets for your search is a fast process, and you can instantly visualize all of them, be it thousands or millions of tweets. There is no other visualization tool that will let you do this with CartoDB's efficiency and speed (other service's Term of Services will limit the ways in which you can use the data)

- Once you have obtained your tweets, you can use all the tools the CartoDB Editor provides to perform Geospatial analysis of the tweets, all inside the same interface, without the need of moving data around (other tools will limit the type of analysis and visualizations you can perform on the data). 


The ability to process great amounts of data, perform analysis, filter data, and style maps easily and beautifuly are some of the reasons why Twitter themselves have choosen CartoDB as their mapping platform for the coverage of recent global events [such](https://twitter.com/TwitterData/timelines/479032120136851458) as this [summers'](http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/brazil-croatia/#/2/24.5/-7.0/0) [World Cup](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/seven-worldcup-data-takeaways-so-far).

With the [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps) CartoDB service you will be able to create maps such as those Twitter itself [has](http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/brazil-croatia/#/2/24.5/-7.0/0) [been](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-sunrise/) [creating](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-india-elections/) in the last months, [which have gotten a great deal of media coverage](http://blog.cartodb.com/cartodb-twitter-maps-in-today-yahoo-espn-time-cnbc/). 

Today, we are excited to announce the next phase of our Twitter Maps service: general availability. We’ve said goodbye to beta and hello to CartoDB Enterprise customers. Get your team started on creating interactive maps from Twitter activity—search for any term, get relevant data directly from Twitter, and map it.
