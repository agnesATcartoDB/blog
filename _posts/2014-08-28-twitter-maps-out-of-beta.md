Earlier last month, we released a beta version of [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps), which gives you the ability to map Twitter activity related to your brand or event. You can search for the terms related to your brand or event directly from the CartoDB Editor, select the period of tweets you want, and start mapping—all in a matter of minutes. 

Twitter Maps is a tool designed for you to gain insights about how people are reacting to your brand or event, among other uses.  Think of it as modern and real-time market research that enables obtaining live data directly from the source, integrating it in visualizations, and sharing it online. The multifunctional CartoDB platform powers this process further with built-in data analysis, dynamic mapping, and design capabilities.

There are some important points which make the CartoDB Twitter Maps service stand out from the alternatives you have in the market. 

- You can download millions of tweets from the last 30 days, versus the 1.000 tweets and 1 day limit of the official Twitter API; if you want to map an event that ocurred during last week, you could not do that just with the Twitter API, but it would be plain easy and fast through the CartoDB Editor using the new Twitter Data Source.

- With the CartoDB Twitter Data Source, you are guaranteed that you will get all geotagged tweets related to your search, not just a fraction (with Twitter API you don't know for sure)

- Retrieving the tweets for your search is a fast process, and you can instantly visualize all of them, be it thousands or millions of tweets. There is no other visualization tool that will let you do this with CartoDB's efficiency and speed.

These are the reasons why Twitter themselves have choosen CartoDB as their mapping platform for the coverage of global events [such](https://twitter.com/TwitterData/timelines/479032120136851458) as this [summers'](http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/brazil-croatia/#/2/24.5/-7.0/0) [World Cup](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/seven-worldcup-data-takeaways-so-far).

With the [Twitter Maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps) CartoDB service you will be able to create maps such as those Twitter itself [has](http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/brazil-croatia/#/2/24.5/-7.0/0) [been](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-sunrise/) [creating](https://cartodb.com/gallery/twitter-india-elections/) in the last months, [which have gotten a great deal of media coverage](http://blog.cartodb.com/cartodb-twitter-maps-in-today-yahoo-espn-time-cnbc/). 

Today, we are excited to announce the next phase of our Twitter Maps service: general availability. We’ve said goodbye to beta and hello to CartoDB Enterprise customers. Get your team started on creating interactive maps from Twitter activity—search for any term, get relevant data directly from Twitter, and map it. The data comes directly from Twitter #qualitycontrol, which ensures that you get most accurate data possible. Yup, it’s really that simple. 

Stay tuned for more on Twitter Maps, and, in the meantime,  please reach out to our dedicated support team with any questions, concerns, or congrats. We love hearing from you.
