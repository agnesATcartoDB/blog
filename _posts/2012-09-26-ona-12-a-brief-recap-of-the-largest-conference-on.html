<p>We had a great time last week at the <a href="http://ona12.journalists.org/">Online News Association</a> (ONA) annual conference, held in San Francisco. The world&#8217;s largest and most important conference on online journalism was an opportunity to hear about &#8220;what’s happening now and what will be happening in the future&#8221; in online media, as Stanford&#8217;s <a href="http://knight.stanford.edu/news-notes/2012/what-i-saw-at-ona-12/">Jim Bettinger</a> says. There were more than 1,400 people in attendance and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-kanalley/ona12-in-tweets-conference_b_1913956.html#slide=more252863">34,505 tweets</a> labelled with the hashtag #ona12. </p>

<p>We participated in <a href="http://themidway.tumblr.com/post/31991523236/data-visualization-with-cartodb">The Midway</a>, an exposition of innovation. We presented and demoed CartoDB to all journalists, organizations and media companies interested in learning more about it as a tool for <a href="http://cartodb.com/journalism">data journalism</a>. We want to thank all of them for their interest. We are really thrilled about the great responses and feedback we received. </p>
<p>On the closing day, hundreds of online media practitioners gathered in the Online Journalism Awards banquet, the only such awards in the country. CartoDB was a finalist in the technology innovation in the service of journalism award. <a href="http://newschallenge1.tumblr.com/post/19405323345/storymap">Here</a> there is the full list of winners and a recap of the night.</p>
<p>The ONA meeting in SF started with a moving keynote by <a href="https://en.twitter.com/joseiswriting">José Antonio Vargas</a> and end up with a celebration of innovation and storytelling in today&#8217;s journalism &#8212;including a standing ovation for <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/">Homicide Watch</a>, awarded with the Knight Award for Public Service. It was a inspiring event. See you next year in Atlanta! </p>
