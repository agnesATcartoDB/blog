We are excited to welcome Jan Marsch to the CartoDB team. Jan will be working on our vector rendering engine.

Jan has been working more than 16 years as a software engineer developing desktop and mobile web applications. During last 5 years he has been working in some of the largest mapping companies. We are very impressed with his deep knowledge of performance on Javascript rendering and we are sure they will be of great use at CartoDB.

Jan is also the creator of the awesome <a href="http://osmbuildings.org/">OSM Buildings</a>, one of the few rendering engines for buildings purely based on HTML5 Canvas and OpenStreetMap. We expect him to continue improving it and keep contributing to core Open Source projects.

He is based in Berlin, the great european startup hub, from where weâ€™ll have some fresh news soon. Stay tuned!
