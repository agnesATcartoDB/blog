The economic impact of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona is estimated to be in excess of 300 million euros, making it one of the city’s most important annual events. With over 1,500 exhibitors and 70,000 visitors from 200 difference countries transferring the city into the de-facto mobile communications industry capitol. 
In order to showcase the real economic impact of the MWC on the city, and utilizing Big Data technology, BBVA analyzed millions of credit card and terminal transactions over the course of a two week period.
Dividing the data into transactions from the week before, and week during the conference, we created a temporal visualization using HTML and Torque, and then showcased those same millions of transitions by local and foreign ones, topographically, over the City of Barcelona. The visualization is available at www.mwcimpact.com. 
We feel that this visualization serves as a model to the type of business intelligence applications that could potentially be built on top of CartoDB, and we truly hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we did building it. 
We’ll be at Mobile World Congress from February 25th through the 28th (Congress Square - Lower Level - Stand CS60) and would love for you to stop by.
