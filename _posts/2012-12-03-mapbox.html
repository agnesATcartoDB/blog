<p><img src="http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/tumblr/posts/mapbox_streets.png"/><span>Most CartoDB maps are based on two layers, the data layer, and the base map. CartoDB produces the data layer and lets you choose a third party base map.  In CartoDB 1.0 only Google Maps were available for the base layer, however, in 2.0 our default base map now comes from <a href="http://mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><span>So why’d we choose to go with MapBox? For many reasons:</span><br/><br/><span>OpenStreetMap</span><br/></strong>MapBox makes beautiful maps based on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data. We love the idea of Open Data and having OpenStreetMap base layers that look stunning is fantastic.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><br/><br/><span>MapBox Streets</span><br/></strong>Their service for base maps offers many possibilities to customize the way the maps look, and they look great, seriously, these guys know how to make beautiful base maps.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><br/><br/><span>Use of Leaflet or any other Open Source library</span><br/></strong><span>When using Google Maps you get the data and the library together, and you cannot separate them. We did not feel totally right forcing users to use a non Open Source library inside CartoDB. And although the Google Maps library is excellent, the freedom you get with Open Source libraries like Leaflet really introduces a lot of new and exciting elements. </span><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><br/><br/><span>We like to support Open Source and a great team</span><br/></strong>MapBox is very similar to us. They produce a lot of Open Source software, really, a lot. And then they create services on top of them. And what a software they produce! For example CartoCSS comes from them, Mapnik is now highly developed by them, etc., and we actually use some of the same code they do, supporting them just feels right.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><span>So why not Google Maps?</span><br/></strong>Now, you may be in the know to battle for base maps that are going on nowadays. Google Maps has been providing a phenomenal service for many years now, but recently started charging for it, which is fine. </p>
<p>Making an excellent base map is really expensive, from data acquisition to delivery technology, it&#8217;s not an easy task. And by providing probably the best base map for free, Google was somehow altered the market not allowing for competitors to join. Now with OpenStreetMap catching up in the amount of data, and providers like MapBox making beautiful maps things are starting to get more interesting.</p>
<p>With that being said, Google Maps is also still available as an option from within CartoDB. So, you have a mix of options to choose from. <br/><br/>You may ask, why didn&#8217;t we make one global base map ourselves? Well, because it is not our core business and we would like to concentrate on the user data layer. People like MapBox are doing a terrific job of it and they have a competitive service, we think is better to partner with them.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><span> </span><br/><br/><span>And what about pricing? </span><br/></strong>First of all, if you don&#8217;t use any base map, like for example <a href="http://viz2.cartodb.com/tables/nyc_subway_entrance_/embed_map?title=false&amp;description=true&amp;search=false&amp;shareable=false&amp;sql=&amp;sw_lat=40.53676418550201&amp;sw_lon=-74.7454833984375&amp;ne_lat=40.91973905106219&amp;ne_lon=-73.125">here</a>, or you use your own base map tiles, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/580074/erepoublic/xavier.html" target="_blank">like here</a>, you do not need to continue reading. But if you do&#8230;<br/><br/>There are no more free base maps out there anymore, therefore we have to take in consideration prices and pricing models. Most users will not have to think about it as they will be way below the limits, but when you have lot of map views you need to consider volume pricing. We make distinction in two scenarios:<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.1673873767722398"><br/><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><br/></strong><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7757131715770811"><span>Base maps inside CartoDB: </span></strong><span>When designing maps, exploring your data and are logged in within the CartoDB dashboard, we handle the cost of base maps. </span></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7757131715770811"><span>Base maps outside CartoDB</span><span>: </span></strong>However, t<span>hose base maps used in embed codes, or used through the APIs are subject to limitations. We provide up to 20,000 map views for free on all plans. After that we will ask you to use your own base maps. That means, that if you are using MapBox you should use your own MapBox account or use Google&#8217;s services. Check out our </span><a href="http://cartodb.com/terms#base_maps"><span>terms of service</span></a><span> for more info.</span><br/><br/>Base maps are an important element in many data visualizations. They help put your data in context. We are very excited to partner with MapBox to provide great base maps and we look forward to seeing more beautiful maps created using CartoDB+MapBox.<br/><br/><strong>Bonus time!</strong><br/>A lot of people ask us, what is the difference between CartoDB and MapBox, and we think this is great time to answer it.</p>
<p>First of all, both companies are good friends, really we are! We both develop Open Source software and create services on top of it. Furthermore, both companies bootstrap from their own resources working on projects that matter (check out <a href="http://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a> and <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a>).</p>
<p>Now, what about the services. Both products actually share lot of the same technologies, again we both love Open Source, like CartoCSS, Mapnik or PostGIS. That is one reason why both products are often times very compatible. You can use MapBox base maps on CartoDB, you can use CartoDB tables on TileMill, etc.</p>
