Ducksboard is the perfect tool to create simple and beautiful <a href="http://www.ducksboard.com">real time dashboards</a> for your metrics. It integrates with dozens of services, from analytics and marketing to CRM, billing tools and more. If you are using any Software as a Service platforms in your company you will be able to create a dashboard with Ducksboard with only a few clicks.

Showing lots of numbers in your dashboard is great, but many times a geospatial view of your data would be even better. Combine metrics and maps, and you get a complete situation room with no effort at all to visualize, understand and track your business in real time. And this has become easy with the new CartoDB integration for Ducksboard.

We have just released the integration of CartoDB maps in Ducksboard. You will be able to include a widget with your CartoDB maps in your dashboard, to create an elegant and real time view of your maps. Including your CartoDB maps in Ducksboard is a straightforward process: just create a new widget, provide your API key and account name, and select which of your CartoDB maps you want to include in your new widget.

Check how easy it is to integrate a CartoDB map in your dashboard:
