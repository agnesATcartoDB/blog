<p class="p1">We want to share a remarkable step for the open data movement in Spain. Based on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Spanish government unveils today a new transparency law for a more open government. </p>
<p class="p1">Following there&#8217;s a quote for the English edition of Madrid-based daily <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/03/22/inenglish/1332436828_249953.html">El País</a>: &#8221;The Cabinet on Friday will approve a far-reaching government transparency law that will give citizens full access to official documents and records, and enforce open government policies at all public agencies to break open the tradition of secrecy in Spanish bureaucracy&#8221;.</p>
<p class="p1">According to El Pais, the three-pronged proposal of the new transparency law covers public contracts, right to information and good governance. Spain is the only EU country with over one million inhabitants with no access to information law. </p>
<p class="p1">Research shows that over one in two requests (54%) never gets any kind of response, while only 20% receive the information requested, according to <a href="http://www.access-info.org/">Access Info Europe</a>, which recently launched a new site called <a href="http://tuderechoasaber.es/">tuderechoasaber.es</a> following the success of projects like <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/">whatdotheyknow.com</a>. Users can make and track requests for information from Spanish public bodies. </p>
