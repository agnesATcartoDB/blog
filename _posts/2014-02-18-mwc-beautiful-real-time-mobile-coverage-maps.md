Coverage Maps are a fundamental marketing and planning tool for any telecom. And a difficult one to make! Creating beautiful maps, up to date, with your company branding is a difficult and costly task. But having CartoDB as your geospatial backend eases much of the pain.

Deimos is a CartoDB partner who have developed Coverage Maps, a product for visualizing mobile coverage maps for telcos. Powered by CartoDB, the tool is a Web-based geospatial post-processing, visualization and reporting solution for Mobile (2G, 3G, 4G), Wi-Fi and other RF networks. Coverage Maps enables fast and easy customization and publication of radiofrecuency-based geodata on the Web.

Coverage Maps is a perfect example of how CartoDB enables and makes very easy to build beautiful, powerful and effective geospatial applications with very little effort. Come and discover how CartoDB can help you build your next geospatial application.

Together with Deimos weâ€™ll be presenting this tool in the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It will be next Monday Feb 24th in Congress Square (CS60). Come and join us!
