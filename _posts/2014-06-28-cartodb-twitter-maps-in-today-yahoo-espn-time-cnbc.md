During the last months CartoDB maps have made it to lots of media outlets, generating millions and millions of map views all around the world covering very different issues. Some of the maps are about the most global event of the summer, the Brazil World Cup.

### Mapping Twitter activity

Twitter is doing an amazing work of analyzing how people is tweeting about the World Cup. You can check out the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TwitterData">Twitter Data account</a>. One of the tools they are using to communicate how the event develops in their platform is CartoDB. They load tweets extracted from their platform into CartoDB to generate animated storytelling maps like this one, which illustrates the match between USA and Portugal:
