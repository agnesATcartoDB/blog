Join us next week in the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Apart from learning about CartoDB in our stand, don't miss the panel (with drinks and jamón!) we are having with **Mapbox** and **Factual**: The importance of Location and Mapping (Spanish Pavilion / Congress Square / CS60, Tuesday 25th of February at 6PM)

Location goes hand-in-hand with mobile phones. Open data is changing the game, making it possible to incorporate real time and unique data feeds into custom maps. Join three open source entrepreneurs for drinks &amp; jamon at MWC, where we’ll talk about the data that is transforming mobile mapping and new ways of visualizing it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/furilo.com/forms/d/1Wzc7GTMTbM8Hm7Wc7JVzfiZFJAQDAJKjziKO869E-Xc/viewform">Sign up for your invite</a>!
