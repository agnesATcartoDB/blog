<p><strong><span>BetaNYC</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Our friends over at BetaNYC have been putting on a series of events to celebrate, educate, and mobilize people around the recently released PLUTO dataset. We put together a fun little <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb-pluto">data service</a></span><span> on <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> and built an unexpectedly popular <a href="http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/index.html">Pluto Data Tour</a> on top of it. This will be our first chance to give a presentation on how and why we built the maps that we did. Be sure to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/betanyc/events/132672342/">come on over on Wednesday</a> if you feel like joining the fun!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Data Wizards</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We will be giving our first ever presentation at the NY meetup, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYData/">NYC Data Wizards</a></span><span>. We are excited to present some of our recent work to this group, including the PLUTO work mentioned above, <a href="http://nychenge.com/">NYCHenge</a>, and other projects. We will be talking about the role of story in data visualization and where we think the future of mapping is going. Last we checked there was only <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYData/events/135133702/">one spot left, so hurry up</a>!</span></p>
