<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are very excited to start the new CartoDB blog. CartoDB is a a geospatial database on the cloud to help you develop location aware applications quickly and easily.Â </p>
<p>So, what can you expect from this blog? Well, lots! We will be publishing here updates on the platforms, new use cases, videos, events where cartoDB is presented, and so on. So if you like Open Data, mashups and maps we think this blog will be of your interest.</p>
<p>Right now we are still on private beta so only a few people has access to CartoDB, but hopefully soon we will open a bit more. Again, welcome everybody!</p>
