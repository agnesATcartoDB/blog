Last week CartoDB was presented at New York Tech Meetup. The audience in the auditorium was over 800 and more over the broadcasting. There was great interest from the NY Tech community.

Following is the video from @jatorre demoing CartoDB using NYC Open Data. The demo shows how to visualize and find which parks in NY have Free wifi.
