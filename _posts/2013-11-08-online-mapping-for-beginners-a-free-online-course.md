A few weeks ago we gave a workshop for <a href="http://nacis.org/">NACIS</a> in South Carolina. We got to show some of the CartoDB basics to a small room of mappers. After we left SC, we started getting a lot of requests to hold workshops more frequently. In response, we decided to put together a small online course to kick it off. 

On December 3rd at 4PM EST we will be hosting an online course streaming from our New York offices. We invite you all to join! We might even throw in some nice surprises if you show up :)

This certainly won’t be our last training so<a href="http://cartodb.com/academy"> stay tuned for future training events</a> at CartoDB.
