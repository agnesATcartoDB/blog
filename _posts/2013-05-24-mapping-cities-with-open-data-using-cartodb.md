Hi, community! Will any of you be available to come meet us <a href="http://sfgisusergroup-es2.eventbrite.com/">this Thursday May 30th in San Francisco for an awesome GIS demonstration</a>? We’ll be showing with a local developer team, Daniell Hebert and Steph Tryphonas of Lab228, how to build applications using open city data. The results for San Francisco are pretty cool!

Come join us &#8212; and bring your questions and suggestions. We’ll be at the San Francisco Department of Technology (1 South Van Ness Ave., 2nd floor) on Thurs. at 10.30am. Register for the free event <a href="http://sfgisusergroup-es2.eventbrite.com/">here</a>.

We will be in SF the entire week in different events, so if you want to meet to talk about CartoDB let us know. But we look forward to seeing you Thursday!
