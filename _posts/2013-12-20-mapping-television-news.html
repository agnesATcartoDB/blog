<p>A new series of maps have been published on the Internet Archive&#8217;s blog showing the location and frequency that US television news has mentioned places around the world. You can see the original blog post here, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2013/12/13/mapping-400000-hours-of-u-s-tv-news/">Mapping 400,000 Hours of U.S. TV News</a>.</p>

<p>The map makes use of computer generated data from 400,000 hours of television news. The system went through 2.7 billion words to find placed names referenced. Next, the authors created a series of maps to explain and explore that data on CartoDB. We are pretty sure this is the first time that television news have ever been mapped in such an interesting and in-depth way! <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2013/12/13/mapping-400000-hours-of-u-s-tv-news/">We are excited to see such a unique dataset being explored through CartoDB</a>.</p>
