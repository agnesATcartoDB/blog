You maybe have not noticed, but FOSS4G North America 2012 has been announce and will happen in Washington DC 10-12th April.
We are big fans of the Open Source Geospatial community of course and we will be present there showing the internals of CartoDB and demoing to whoever is interested in learning more.
Additionally we are proud sponsors of the event and we look forward to contribute in any other possible way we can. Building community is a very important aspect of Open Source.
Hope to see everybody in DC!
