<p>The annual <a href="http://www.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G</a> conference is the largest global gathering focused on open source geospatial software. This year will happen in September in Portland, Oregon (USA), and CartoDB will be present with several sessions (How to tell stories and engage an audience with maps, Dynamic mapping on the web: building a scalable service for thousands of companies, The unrelenting progress of design in open sourceâ€¦).</p>

<p>As a geospatial conference, maps will be an integral part of it, and the organization has opened a Call for Maps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We invite contributions to the FOSS4G Map Gallery to build an exciting and vibrant exhibit of the very best in mapping. This Map Gallery will not only demonstrate the work of delegates but also act as a reference point for the current state of mapping more widely. We encourage all delegates to share one example of their work and help us create a cartographic record of the FOSS4G 2014 conference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we invite all CartoDB users and map creators everywhere to contribute to what will surely be an amazing Map Gallery. <a href="https://2014.foss4g.org/gallery-submissions/">Sumit yours today</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=Submit%20your%20maps%20to%20the%20FOSS4G%20map%20gallery%20http://blog.cartodb.com/post/90658865894/submit-your-maps-to-the-foss4g-map-gallery">spread the word</a>!</p>
