As many of you already know, we have been working on the 2.1 version of CartoDB for several months now. In the upcoming release, we are incorporating multi-layer support, new visualization wizards, and a new and improved way to publish and save your visualizations.

Since this version is going to changeÂ a bit the way some users interact with the service, we are selecting a few users to test it out before we release it to the everyone. Today, we are ready to release the sneak peek to those users.

We are looking forward to sharing new features with the community and getting some valuable feedback. If you are interested in getting early beta access, drop us an email and let us know!
Cheers!
