<p>Yesterday we announced the beta release of Odyssey.js, the open source library that enables journalists, designers and creators to build map-based interactive stories on the web. How can you use it? Itâ€™s easy! Here is a quick intro:</p>

<h3>Create a new project in only three steps</h3>

<p><strong>1. Combine visualizations with narrative</strong></p>

<p>Do you have a great idea? That and a modern web-browser is the only thing needed to make a beautiful narrative project online. Start creating your story in the <a href="http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/">Odyssey.js</a> sandbox we have created for anyone to explore and play around. Choose the template that better suits the story you want to tell: slides, scroll or torque (animated map).</p>

<p>If your story is simple and the map is the principal element, the slide template will be the best option. On the other hand, the scroll template works better with stories that have a lot of editorial content such as images and texts. Finally, if your data is animated, the torque template is perfect for adding extra information to your stories.</p>

<p><strong>2. Markdown editing</strong></p>

<p>Markdown is a human readable markup language which is an easy way to write text on the web that easily translates into HTML. The Odyssey.js sandbox allows you to write your story using Markdown. A story is divided into chapters, which lets you give structure to your story. Each chapter begins with a tittle and then can contain a mix of headlines, text and other Markdown elements (images, links, etc.). In the sandbox you also have controls to define the position and zoom of the map, as well as controls for the animated stories.</p>

<p><strong>3. One click publishing</strong></p>

<p>Sharing your final story is one click away. Using the publish button you can download the project to save a local copy, you can have a public link to share and view your story or even have a code to embed your creation on your website or blog.</p>

<p>Here you have a screencast that walks you through the process:</p>
