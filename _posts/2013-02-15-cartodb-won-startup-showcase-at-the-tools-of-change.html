<p>This past Wednesday we attended <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=O'Reilly's+Tools+of+Change+for+Publishing&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=O'Reilly's+Tools+of+Change+for+Publishing&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3.255&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Tools of Change for Publishing conference</a> in New York as a Startup Showcase final contestant, and on the following day we were informed that we had been selected as one of three winners. <br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/27033">ten finalists</a>, and even the semi-final twenty were all great projects with monumental potential in the publishing space. <br/><br/>As a company that is not centrally focused on publishing, being treated with such high regard in the community is not only a great honor to us, but we&#8217;re absolutely humbled by the amazing reaction which we received from the publishing and journalism community. It is a great demonstration of the flexibility of our product to match different needs on different sectors.<br/><br/>In order to acknowledge this, we have decided to offer a limited three month 10% discount code for this week only on all new paid CartoDB accounts. Simply enter the code &#8220;TOCCONPUBLISHER&#8221; when you sign up for a paid plan to receive the discount. <br/><br/>Thanks you all so much, and we look forward to seeing many more maps and visualizations built by the publishing and journalism communities in the months to come. Stay tune!</p>
