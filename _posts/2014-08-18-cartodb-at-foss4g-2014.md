One more year CartoDB will have a great presence in the largest open source geospatial conference, [FOSS4G](https://2014.foss4g.org"). As an [open source project](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb) we couldn't miss this date, and several members of the team will be in Portland showing what we are currently working on, and what makes of CartoDB one of the greatest GIS cloud platforms. This are the sessions and workshops we'll be offering:
