Soon, CartoDB will join the largest open-source geospatial conference, [FOSS4G](https://2014.foss4g.org") with a permanent presence. As a leading [open-source project](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb), we're excited about this event and will be sending several members of the CartoDB team to Portland to participate. We look forward to showing you what sets the CartoDB GIS cloud apart, and hope to see you at our following sessions and workshops:
