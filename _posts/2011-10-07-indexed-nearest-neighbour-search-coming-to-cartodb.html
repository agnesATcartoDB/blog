<p>Take a sneak peek at some upcoming functionality to CartoDB: Indexed nearest neighbour search. Thanks to <a href="http://blog.opengeo.org/2011/09/28/indexed-nearest-neighbour-search-in-postgis/">CartoDB investment in PostGIS 2.0</a>, you can now find the nearest N things to anywhere on the planet at ultra fast speed!</p>

<p>This new functionality lets you run classic user friendly queries like &#8220;where are the 10 nearest sushi restaurants to me?&#8221;, or, &#8220;how close are the nearest 10 sightings of Puma Concolor to me&#8230;?&#8221; ;)</p>
<p>In this demo, you can see how simple interacting with this new functionality though CartoDB is, and get a feel for the sorts user friendly queries you can run against your own data. This functionality will be rolling out to all our users over the next few weeks - so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;re really proud to invest in the PostGIS project. Thanks go out especially to Paul, <span> </span><span>Oleg and Teodor for helping implement this new functionality</span>! </p>
