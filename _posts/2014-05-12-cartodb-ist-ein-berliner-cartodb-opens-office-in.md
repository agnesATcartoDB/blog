### New office in Berlin

**We are happy to announce the opening of our 3rd office worldwide. After New York and Madrid comes Berlin**. In recent years, Berlin has become the great European startup hub, attracting tons of startups and talent from all over Europe. And when talking about maps, Germany is a very important place. It is home to many geolocation companies, has one of the most active OpenStreetMap communities - with contributors providing a never-before-seen level of detail - and has lots of organizations contributing to the ecosystem.

**Germany is the 4th biggest market in the world for CartoDB.** With customers in more than 40 countries, Germany is one of the most important for CartoDB. The opening of this new office in Berlin means that we’ll not only continue to provide a great level of service to our customers, but will also expand our presence in Germany.

This news follows the <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/post/85117772814/jan-marsch-creator-of-osm-buildings-joins-cartodb">recent announcement of Jan Marsch</a> (creator of OSM Buildings) joining the CartoDB team.

### Celebrate the opening with us, come to CartoDBeers Berlin

To celebrate our new presence in Berlin, we are hosting our first (of many to come!) CartoDBeers in Berlin. CartoDBeers are informal meetings of people interested in maps, during which we host talks from different people in the community or just hang out to have a CartoDBeer and talk about maps.
