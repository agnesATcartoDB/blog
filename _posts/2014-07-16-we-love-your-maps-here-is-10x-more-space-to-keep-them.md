The maps we have been seeing come from you lately have been amazing. We are seeing incredible projects like the [Urban Reviewer](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/91036143049/map-of-the-week-urban-reviewer), insanely popular [Twitter maps](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/90139923789/cartodb-twitter-maps-in-today-yahoo-espn-time-cnbc), and the [NGO Aid Map](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/88566554684/the-ngo-aid-map-a-new-project-powered-by-cartodb) coming online everyday it seems. We love it and couldn't be more grateful for such an awesome and inspiring [community](https://cartodb.com/gallery) of users. Now, we want to make it easier for new users to see the full potential of [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) in your projects. Today we are announcing a 10x increase in space for free accounts! That's 50MBs to start mapping for free! These changes are immediate, so if you are using a free account, you should be able to login and see the update right now.

<!--more-->

We think that our free accounts will go a long way for journalists, NGOs, and businesses to start seeing data come to life right away. In just our free account, you get access to all the simplicity of [data uploads](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#tables), [styling wizards](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-editor.html#managing-your-data), [Torque](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/introduction_torque.html)  and our new [Odyssey.js](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/) tool. If you know users that have been reluctant to dive into CartoDB, now is a great opportunity to get them started. If you haven't already, [sign-up](https://cartodb.com/signup) today.

Don't forget, CartoDB grows with you, so if 50MB still isn't enough, we've got [accounts](http://cartodb.com/pricing) that will work. In addition to higher quotas, paid accounts will still bring you increased privacy controls, removable branding, increased geocoding, data solutions such as [Twitter maps](http://cartodb.com/solutions/twitter-maps) and more! Get in touch if you want to know how to make use of bigger accounts on our service. 

For now though, enjoy our greatly expanded free account and [spread the word](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.cartodb.com%2Fpost%2F91953389729%2Fwe-love-your-maps-here-is-10x-more-space-to-keep-them&related=cartodb&text=10x%20more%20space%20for%20free%20to%20learn%20online%20mapping&tw_p=tweetbutton&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.cartodb.com%2Fpost%2F91953389729%2Fwe-love-your-maps-here-is-10x-more-space-to-keep-them&via=cartodb)! Be sure to let us know what you build. We love your [Tweets](https://cartodb.com/love)! (If you already had a CartoDB account, your quota has been upgraded, so take this opportunity to keep creating visualizations)

Happy mapping!
