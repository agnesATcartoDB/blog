In Southern Spain, there is a city that was once the capital of Hispania Baetica during the Roman Empire. At present it is well known because of its incredible cultural and monumental patrimony: Cordoba, in the community of Andalusia.

Thanks to its historic legacy, the old town of Cordoba was recognized in 1994 as a World Heritage Site (the Mosque-Cathedral and also to all the streets and buildings around it).
 
In this blog post, we would like to show you how the [Urbanism Municipal Management](http://www.gmucordoba.es/) of the City Council of Cordoba, fulfilling one of the main objectives of providing information to citizens in a simple and comprehensive way, has made use of CartoDB to visualize important data of the area.

 
**Mapping plans, building, collections and archaeological interventions**
 
 
Since 2013, the city administration has been publishing data and important information of the territorial and urban management of Cordoba on the official website [www.gmucordoba.es](http://www.gmucordoba.es/). All the information with a geographic or spatial component has been included in the category ["Plans and Maps”](http://www.gmucordoba.es/accesibilidad-en-espacios-publicos) and that is where CartoDB has made its appearance.
 
 
**Development plans in the city**

What better but to show the development plans in a visual manner. In this interactive map, the administration is able to display where the work will take place and, at the same time, share documentation and context information.
 
 
**Buildings on undeveloped land**

The Council of Cordoba has done extensive work examining the undeveloped lands in the area using different photogrammetric and mapping bases. On this map, the clusters of existing buildings on undeveloped land in the municipality of Cordoba are presented. To know more about the topic, go [here]( http://www.gmucordoba.es/parcelaciones).  The information is only available in Spanish.
 
 
**Protected goods collection of the historic center of Cordoba**

As we said before, Cordoba is recognized due to its incredible cultural and monumental patrimony. Therefor, a protected goods collection of the historic center exists. On the map above you can observe where the most important buildings, monuments and landmarks of the city are located, as well as significant additional information.
 
 
**Archaeological interventions**

This is an interactive visualization that shows everything from cadastral parcels and roads to areas subjected to development planning, where has been made an archaeological intervention. The information is current as of September 2009 and includes the basic data for its contextualization.
 
As an open data initiative, some of data sets are open to download in various cartographic formats (CSV, KML, Shapefile, and GeoJSON) and can be used in accordance with the license specified in the legal notice of the web portal. According to the City Council of Cordoba, the preparation and design data to publish in CartoDB has been made ​​by the company [Almagre](http://www.almagre.es/).
 
When we asked the maps development team of the Council of Cordoba why they decided to use CartoDB instead of other visualization tools, the answer was clear: "The selection of CartoDB was marked by the possibilities of the tool to generate visualizations easily and quickly, allowing us to edit published data and selecting information offered. Also, CartoDB allows to do more advanced work using HTML language to include pictures or links on our website."
 
 
**Archaeological Routes: “Arqueología somos todos”**
 
 
CartoDB seems to be the favorite tool to share the rich heritage that encompasses Cordoba. We invite you to also take a look at the [Research Group Sísifo]( http://www.gruposisifo.com/) project “Arqueología somos todos”, where you can discover all the Archaeological Routes in Cordoba through an interactive map.
