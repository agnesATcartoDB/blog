<p>Eight million people followed yesterday the YouTube live stream from the <a href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/">Red Bull Stratos Challenge</a>. According to the video service, it was the largest-ever simultaneous viewing for a web audience.</p>
<p>As we were watching how Felix Baumgartner made the highest and fastest jump in history, we ran a <a href="http://jatorre.github.com/stratos/index.html">live map</a> powered by CartoDB . It featured Baumgartner location on New Mexico as he ascended to an altitude over 120,000 feet and as he rushed toward earth at a supersonic speed, and became the first man to break the sound barrier under his own power. </p>
<p>This is an screenshot of the live demo coupled with a video feed while Baumgartner was ascended:</p>

<p>This maps tracks altitude from starting point to the landing site (blue represents the lowest altitude, while red, the highest):</p>

<p>This map shows the landing site:</p>

<p>To fetch the data from the Red Bull Stratos site, we used this <a href="https://gist.github.com/3891365">Python script</a>. It retrieves the coordinates, the vertical speed and other data coming from Baumgartner&#8217;s GPS, and uses the <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/cartodb-apis.html">CartoDB API key</a> to perform writes and updates to a CartoDB account in realtime. </p>
<p>Thus, we could follow the exact position of Braumgartner &#8212;while the data live stream was not truncated, which happened often during the freefall jump. You can download the whole RAW data captured live, including the blank cells, <a href="https://javi.cartodb.com/tables/stratos/public/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Do you want to calculate the furtherst distance travelled from the starting point? You can run these <a href="https://gist.github.com/3891312">queries</a> we&#8217;ve put together to make it easier. </p>
<p>This simple setup allowed us to test real-time data visualization using CartoDB. We&#8217;ll keep developing it so all users can build this kind of live-stream maps with ease. Stay tuned. </p>
