A group of 34 industry-leading journalists and new media professionals teamed up to review entrants and select finalists, said ONA in a statement. We are honored and excited to be included in this list.

Since CartoDB was launched last April, we rigorously tested and developed it through collaborations with online media specialists, publications and universities to make it an useful data journalism tool. Though ongoing feedback we are able to continuously improve the platform to provide more value, ease work flow, and make data journalism easier than ever before.

We'll be there attending the conference since Thursday, Sept. 20, and will participate in <a href="http://ona12.journalists.org/midway/">The Midway</a>, ONA's open-space of innovation in the service of journalism.
