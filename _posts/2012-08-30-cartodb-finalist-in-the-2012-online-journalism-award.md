The Online News Association (ONA) and its academic partner, the School of Communication at the University of Miami, have announced the finalist for the 2012 Online Journalism Award. CartoDB is nominated for the Gannett Foundation Award for Technical Innovation in the Service of Digital Journalism. 

The full list is available here. 
A group of 34 industry-leading journalists and new media professionals teamed up to review entrants and select finalists, said ONA in a statement. We are honored and excited to be included in this list.
Since CartoDB was launched last April, we rigorously tested and developed it through collaborations with online media specialists, publications and universities to make it an useful data journalism tool. Though ongoing feedback we are able to continuously improve the platform to provide more value, ease work flow, and make data journalism easier than ever before. 
The results of the 2012 Online Journalism Award will be announced at the 2012 ONA Conference on Saturday, Sept. 22, in San Francisco. We’ll be there attending the conference since Thursday, Sept. 20, and will participate in The Midway, ONA’s open-space of innovation in the service of journalism.
If you want to stop by, meet up, or similar, just contact @cmdelaserna or @jgrebski.  We’ll be happy to meet you.
