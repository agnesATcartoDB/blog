<p class="p1">As you may know, we at CartoDB try and take huge strides towards facilitating the process of map making as easy as possible, and while CartoDB gives advanced uses a robust functionality that meets almost all their geospatial and data visualization needs, we know that it&#8217;s important to bring the more popular functionalities to the UI, enabling less advanced users of the platform to utilize the same functionality without prior knowledge of code. </p>
<p class="p1">And thanks to the latest version of <a href="http://mapnik.org/"><span class="s1">Mapnik</span></a>, we&#8217;re happy to introduce the <strong>composite operation selector</strong>, a new shortcut that will open up vast new customization possibilities. </p>
<p class="p1">Composite operations affect the way colors and textures mix with one another, and if you&#8217;re familiar with image editing software such as PhotoShop or Fireworks, chances are you&#8217;ll recognize some of these composite models in the new combo selector. </p>
<p class="p1">The image at the top of this post shows you how the &#8220;populated places&#8221; dataset from <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/"><span class="s1">naturalearthdata.org</span></a> looks when you apply a multiply composite operation. </p>
<p class="p1">Technically speaking, the only thing this combo does is it adds in some of the composite operation as a new CartoCSS property to your style code, so if you&#8217;re up to it, go into your CartoCSS editor and start playing aroung with <span class="s1">all the available operations</span><span class="s2">. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Check out for example this map created by a <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article16159276.ab">Swedish newspaper</a> about the location of the most toxic areas in the country.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Experiment with the new operations and let us know what you think.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Happy mapping!</p>
