Almost since the first release of CartoDB a couple years back, we have regularly received requests for easier legends in embedded and shared maps. We understand fully where these people were coming from, heck, we wanted legends pretty badly ourselves. For a lot of the time in between, we have focused our small team on bringing you faster maps, easier visualizations, and improved publishing tools. So,we take it as a sign of just how far CartoDB has come that we finally integrated legends into the user-interface.

We didn’t want to bring you legends that were pre-canned and often missing your intention, so we built them to be incredibly flexible and customizable. If you want to see just how easy it is to start adding legends to your maps, take a minute to watch the screencast below.

You can start adding legends to all your existing visualizations or add them to new ones in the future. We have made legends compatible not just with embedded visualizations and shared links, but we also integrated them with the CartoDB.js library. Take a look at the API documentation to see how you can use them in your Javascript applications right away. Over the coming months, we’ll be adding even more flexibility and options for creating your legends, including full HTML customization.
Legends are one of a handful of great features we’ll be rolling out to make your mapping life a little bit easier. Let us know what you think on Twitter!
