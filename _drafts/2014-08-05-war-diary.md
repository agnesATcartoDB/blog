The Operation War Diary is a project launched by Zoouniverse in partnership with  Imperial War Museum and the National Archives. They are basically asking to the public to help them to transcribe and tag the diaries of the British Army on the Western Front during the First World War. 

The main aid of this project is make valuable First World War information available to academics, researchers and family historians around the world.

Although the  Operation War Diary just started a couple of months, the results are already starting to appear and they are using CartoDB to show them to the world. Here is an example: a map of reports, from 200 battalion diaries, of men killed on the Western Front, 1914 - 1918.
